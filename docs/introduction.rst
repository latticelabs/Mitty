Trivia
======
Since you were dying to know: Mitty comes from James Thurber's `"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"`_ one of my
favourite pieces from one of my favourite authors. Though Wikipedia_ has a less favourable interpretation of what
Walter Mitty stands for, I always thought that Thurber was celebrating the dreamer within each us who spices up the banal
parts of life with a little harmless fantasy.
